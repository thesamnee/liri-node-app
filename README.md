LIRI is a virtual assistant that will help you with various everyday tasks.

If you want LIRI to search for information on a song, use "song" as your first argument, then type in the name of the song you'd like to find.

In a movie mood? Make "movie" your first argument and then type the name of the movie you're looking for.

LIRI can also find out when your favorite artists have shows scheduled. Type "concert", then the artist you're looking for.
